# Plugin `eu.xenit.docker`: Build a Docker image from a Dockerfile

First, you need to apply the plugin to your `build.gradle`.

```groovy
plugins {
    id "eu.xenit.docker" version "5.3.2" // See https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/eu.xenit.docker for the latest version
}
```

## Configuration

Then you can configure the `dockerBuild` configuration to set the Dockerfile, repositories and tags for the image that will be built.

If a `Dockerfile` exists in the root of your project, it will be used as the Dockerfile for the image build.
Else, the Dockerfile generated by `createDockerFile` will be used for the image build.

Repositories and tags are combined to produce the full image name that will be built.
Repositories and tags are optional. If none (or an empty list) are provided, the image will not have a name and can't be pushed to a repository.

```groovy
dockerBuild {
    dockerFile = file('Dockerfile') // or `createDockerFile.destFile`

    // Repositories to publish to.
    // Full image names will be constructed by cartesian product of repositories and tags
    repositories = ['xenit/example-docker-plugin', 'hub.xenit.eu/private/example-docker-plugin']
    tags = ['1','1.0','test']
}
```

## Tasks

### `createDockerFile`: Programmatically create a Dockerfile

The `createDockerFile` task is of type [`DockerfileWithCopyTask`](../src/main/java/eu/xenit/gradle/docker/tasks/DockerfileWithCopyTask.java).
It contains all methods of [the `Dockerfile` task type](https://bmuschko.github.io/gradle-docker-plugin/api/com/bmuschko/gradle/docker/tasks/image/Dockerfile.html), and adds a `smartCopy` method to easily add files.

You can build your whole Dockerfile programmatically with this task.
This comes in handy when you want to add build artifacts to the Dockerfile, or want to generate it dynamically based on some custom logic.

```groovy
createDockerFile {
    from("debian")
    runCommand("apt-get install default-jre")
    volume("/data")
    smartCopy(jar, "/opt/app/app.jar")
    workingDir("/opt/app/")
    defaultCommand("java", "-jar", "app.jar")
}
```

#### Using `smartCopy` to copy files

A `smartCopy` method is available to make it easier to copy any file in the project to the Docker image.

`smartCopy` works similar to `copyFile`, except that paths are relative to the project directory instead of relative to the Dockerfile.
There is no limitation to the location of files that are copied with `smartCopy`, files can originate from outside the project directory.

<details>
<summary><code>smartCopy</code> invocations</summary>

* single file or directory inputs:
    * `smartCopy(String source, String destination)`: Evaluated as `smartCopy(project.file(source), destination)`, `source` is resolved using [`Project#file()`](https://docs.gradle.org/current/javadoc/org/gradle/api/Project.html#file-java.lang.Object-).
    * `smartCopy(File source, String destination)`: Copies file or directory `source` to `destination` in the Docker image.
        * If `destination` does not exist, the `source` will be copied to that path
        * If `destination` is an already existing directory, `source` will be copied inside that directory. This is the same behavior as the Docker COPY instruction and the Unix cp command have.
    * `smartCopy(Provider<File> source, String destination)`
    * `smartCopy(Provider<File> source, Provider<String> destination)`
* file collections:
    * `smartCopy(FileCollection source, String destination)`: Copies the files in `source` to the directory `destination` in the Docker image. Contrary to the single-file copy, `destination` is forced to be a directory.
    * `smartCopy(FileCollection source, Provider<String> destination)`

</details>

```groovy
createDockerFile {
    // Copy the contents of "directory123" in your project to /opt/directory123 in the Docker image
    smartCopy "directory123", "/opt/directory123"
    // Copy the file "file123" in your project to /opt/file123 in the Docker image
    // Note: when copying a file and /opt/file123 is an already existing directory, the file will be copied to /opt/file123/file123
    // This is standard behavior of both Docker COPY and the Unix cp command
    smartCopy "file123", "/opt/file123"

    // Copy all files of a FileCollection or Configuration into a folder
    smartCopy files("lib"), "/tmp/classes"
    smartCopy runtimeClasspath, "/tmp/classes"
}
```

### `buildDockerImage`: Build the configured Docker image

The `buildDockerImage` task is of type [`DockerBuildImage`](https://bmuschko.github.io/gradle-docker-plugin/api/com/bmuschko/gradle/docker/tasks/image/DockerBuildImage.html).

It is automatically configured to use the Dockerfile that is configured in `dockerBuild.dockerFile` and to tag the images with names generated from `dockerBuild.repositories` and `dockerBuild.tags`.

### `pushDockerImage`: Push the built Docker image to its repository

The `pushDockerImage` task is of type [`DockerPushImage`](https://bmuschko.github.io/gradle-docker-plugin/api/com/bmuschko/gradle/docker/tasks/image/DockerPushImage.html).

It is automatically configured to push all the tagged images that are built by `buildDockerImage` to their respective repositories.


## Example

An example for this plugin can be found in the [docker plugin example](../src/integrationTest/examples/example-docker-plugin)

```bash
cd src/integrationTest/examples/example-docker-plugin
../../../../gradlew buildDockerImage
```
